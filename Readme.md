BONVO NFT

  

5. Project description.

Bonvo NFT is a real estate application, a platform built on top of Moonbean Network, a Polkadot parachain.

It is a smart contract complex, a set of tools that helps users to earn rewards by using the platform. It also gives the user the ability to mint their property, as an NFT. Bonvo uses the technology of RMRK soulbound NFTs, this allows users to receive different NFTs attached to this one, to show the status of their reputation in the platform.

  

It allows users to rent and list properties for rent. Integrating different parachains uses and characteristics, allowing a variety of features to be used.

  

Landlords are able to upload their properties into the platform, mint these properties as an NFT, nest NFTs into NFTs, list their properties for rent, interact with tenants, rate them and more.

Tenants can rent properties, rate and comment on their experience with the property and with the landlord.

  

This creates a reputational dashboard, where users can see how other users are ranked, according to their behavior and allowing them to make a decision based on solid information.

  

An important part of the smart contracts technology used for this project include: Escrow Smart Contracts, Multi - asset (Multi - resource) NFTs, Soulbound NFTs and nested NFTs

9. Problem description.

  

The lack of incentives and adequate recognition for the real estate’s industry participants (landlords and tenants). Another issue identified is the lack of reputation based on previous behavior and conduct of the industry’s participants.

Other problems identified in the broad real estate industry are the inefficiency, the inaccessibility, and transparency in the process of renting a property or putting a property for rent.

  

10. Solution or how the project helps to solve the problem.

Bonvo NFT is a Dapp where users (landlords and tenants) can create a profile and interact with its features. Bonvo seeks to allow users to tokenize their properties and put them for rent. This property will be minted as an NFT and it can be rented through the platform. Users are rewarded with BNV tokens (This is the native fungible utility token of the dapp, needed to register, to upload a property and to rent properties) when they rent or put their properties for rent.

Bonvo NFT creates a reputational dashboard based on users behavior and conduct. This is possible by using Soulbound NFTs. These Soulbound NFTs are given to users, they cannot be transferred. Other NFTs created specifically to rate different characteristics and behavior, are given to users and attached to the Soulbound NFT.

  

Bonvo NFT aims to help improving the real estate industry in several ways:

  

Accessibility: By tokenizing properties, it becomes possible for a wide range of investors to access them.

  

Transparency: A blockchain-based property tokenization platform provides a permanent and transparent record of all rental-related transactions and contracts, which can help reduce uncertainty and increase trust in the rental process.

  

Incentives: By offering incentives in the form of tokens to users who rent properties, more transactions can be stimulated and participation in the platform increased. These tokens could also be used for discounts on future rentals or property purchases.

  

Efficiency: By automating and digitizing the rental process, the property search and contracting process can be streamlined and simplified, resulting in a more efficient and comfortable experience for users.

  
  
  
  

11. Tech stack

How the project uses substrate:

- We're using Moonbase Alpha, the test network for 2 parachains of Kusama and Polkadot: Moonriver and Moonbeam.

Tech Stack: - Hardhat for development environment

- Solidity as programming language.

- For testing: ethers, typescript, typechain, chai, mocha, OpenZeppelin test helpers.

- Moonbase Alpha to deploy the contracts.

- RMRK Protocol EVM package for advanced NFTs.

- Javascript (Framework React)

- React

- Web3.storage for IPFS hosted files

- Vercel as hosting
